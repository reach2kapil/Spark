**Project Title: Flight Data Analysis with PySpark**
Objective
Analyze flight data to summarize trends, identify delays, and extract actionable insights using PySpark and associated libraries.

Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
Load the dataset (likely CSV or Parquet format) using PySpark's SparkSession.
Inspect the schema and handle any missing or inconsistent data.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Remove or impute null values.
Parse dates, times, and numerical fields for accurate analysis.
Generate derived columns, such as flight delay durations or weekday indicators.

3. Data Aggregation
Group data by relevant categories, such as airlines, destinations, or time periods.
Compute metrics like average delays, total flights, and cancellation rates.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize key metrics using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Highlight patterns, such as peak flight times or most delayed routes.

5. Output Generation
Create summaries, such as:
Top 10 delayed airlines.
Busiest airports.
Trends in flight volumes over time.
Store processed data for reporting or further analysis.

6. Report Creation
Combine analysis and visualizations into a summary notebook for presentation.

**Final Outputs**
Key Metrics:

Average delay times per airline.
Total flight counts are grouped by day, month, or year.
Visualizations:

Bar charts and line graphs show trends and outliers.

**Insights:**
Identification of inconsistent fair prices for different airlines.
